# Instant Pot Mixed Bean and Grain Soup

### **Ingredients:**
- **1 cup mixed beans and grains** (e.g., lentils, pinto beans, quinoa, barley)
- **6 cups vegetable or chicken broth**
- **1-2 tablespoons olive oil**
- **1 large onion**, diced
- **2-3 cloves garlic**, minced
- **2-3 carrots**, diced
- **2-3 celery stalks**, diced
- **1-2 tomatoes**, diced (optional)
- **2 bay leaves**
- **1 teaspoon ground cumin**
- **1 teaspoon paprika** (smoked paprika adds a nice depth)
- **1 teaspoon dried thyme** or **oregano** (optional)
- **Salt and pepper**, to taste
- **Fresh herbs** (like parsley or cilantro), chopped for garnish
- **Optional additions:** spinach or kale, diced potatoes, bell peppers, lemon juice, etc.

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Beans and Grains:**
   - **Sort and Rinse:** Spread out your mixed beans and grains on a clean surface to remove any debris or damaged pieces. Rinse them thoroughly under cold running water using a fine-mesh sieve or colander.
   - **No Soaking Needed:** Unlike stovetop methods, the Instant Pot can handle unsoaked beans and grains efficiently, reducing preparation time.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics:**
   - **Activate Sauté Mode:** Press the **"Sauté"** button on your Instant Pot and set it to **"Medium"** heat.
   - **Heat Olive Oil:** Once hot, add **1-2 tablespoons of olive oil**.
   - **Cook Onions:** Add the **diced onion** and sauté for about **3-4 minutes** until they become translucent.
   - **Add Garlic:** Stir in the **minced garlic** and cook for an additional **1 minute** until fragrant.

3. **Add Vegetables and Seasonings:**
   - **Incorporate Carrots and Celery:** Add the **diced carrots** and **celery stalks**, stirring to combine. Sauté for another **2-3 minutes**.
   - **Optional Tomatoes:** If using, add the **diced tomatoes** and cook for **1-2 minutes** to soften.
   - **Spice It Up:** Sprinkle in the **ground cumin**, **paprika**, and **dried thyme or oregano** (if using). Stir well to evenly coat the vegetables with the spices.

4. **Combine Beans, Grains, and Broth:**
   - **Add Mixed Beans and Grains:** Pour in the **1 cup of mixed beans and grains**.
   - **Pour in Broth:** Add **6 cups of vegetable or chicken broth**. Ensure that all ingredients are well submerged.
   - **Add Bay Leaves:** Toss in the **2 bay leaves** for added flavor.

5. **Pressure Cook the Soup:**
   - **Seal the Instant Pot:** Close the lid securely and ensure the valve is set to **"Sealing"**.
   - **Set Cooking Time:** Press the **"Manual"** or **"Pressure Cook"** button and set the timer for **25 minutes** on **High Pressure**.
     > [!TIP]
     > If your mixed beans and grains include varieties that require longer cooking times, 25 minutes should suffice for most. If your mix contains particularly firm beans, you might extend the time by an additional 5-10 minutes.

6. **Natural Pressure Release:**
   - **Let It Release Naturally:** Once the cooking time is complete, allow the Instant Pot to **release pressure naturally** for about **15-20 minutes**. This helps prevent beans from splitting and ensures even cooking.
   - **Quick Release Residual Pressure:** After the natural release, carefully turn the valve to **"Venting"** to release any remaining pressure.

7. **Final Touches:**
   - **Open the Lid:** Once all pressure has been released, open the Instant Pot lid.
   - **Remove Bay Leaves:** Take out the **bay leaves** and discard them.
   - **Adjust Consistency:** If the soup is too thick for your liking, you can add more broth or water to reach your desired consistency. Stir well.
   - **Season to Taste:** Add **salt and pepper** according to your preference. Remember that broth may already contain some salt, so adjust accordingly.
   - **Add Greens (Optional):** For added nutrition and color, stir in some **spinach or kale** during this stage. The residual heat will wilt the greens without overcooking them.
   - **Fresh Herbs:** Mix in freshly **chopped parsley or cilantro** for a burst of freshness.
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Remove the bay leaves before serving to avoid any choking hazards.

8. **Serve:**
   - **Ladle and Garnish:** Serve the soup hot, garnished with additional fresh herbs, a drizzle of olive oil, or a squeeze of lemon juice for brightness.
   - **Side Suggestions:** Pair with crusty bread, a side salad, or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan for a complete meal.
     > [!WARNING]
     > Be cautious when performing a quick release as the steam can be very hot and may cause burns.

### **Tips for Instant Pot Success:**
> [!TIP]
> - **Layering Ingredients:** Ensure that the beans and grains are fully submerged in the liquid. If necessary, add a bit more broth or water.
> - **Preventing Foam Build-Up:** Some beans can cause foaming during pressure cooking. To minimize this, avoid overfilling the Instant Pot and ensure adequate liquid.
> - **Flavor Depth:** Sautéing the aromatics and spices before pressure cooking enhances the soup's flavor profile significantly.
> - **Storage:** This soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to **5-7 days** or frozen for up to **3 months**. It often tastes even better the next day as flavors meld.
> - **Customizations:** Feel free to customize the soup with your favorite vegetables, proteins (like diced chicken or sausage), or spices to suit your taste preferences.
