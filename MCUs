# Microcontroller Communication Protocols and Drone Technologies

This document provides a comprehensive overview of key communication protocols used in microcontrollers (UART and I2C) and the distinctions between telemetry systems and RC receivers. Additionally, it includes a detailed guide to microcontroller pinouts, relevant to drone technology and the development of in-house testing automation for flight controllers, particularly focusing on systems like ArduPilot and INAV Configurator.

## UART vs I2C in Microcontrollers

### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
- **Communication Type**: Asynchronous serial communication, no clock signal required.
- **Data Transfer**: Data transmitted one bit at a time over a single wire (plus a ground wire).
- **Devices Supported**: Generally supports communication between two devices.
- **Complexity**: Simple in implementation but less efficient for multiple devices.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripherals.

### I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- **Communication Type**: Synchronous serial communication, two-wire protocol requiring a clock signal.
- **Data Transfer**: Data and clock signals transmitted over two wires (SDA and SCL).
- **Devices Supported**: Supports multiple devices in a master-slave configuration on the same bus.
- **Complexity**: More complex due to addressing and arbitration, efficient for multiple sensors or devices.
- **Use Cases**: Used for connecting low-speed peripherals like sensors, displays, and EEPROMs.

## Telemetry vs RC Receiver in Drones

### Telemetry
- **Function**: Involves collecting and transmitting data from remote points for analysis.
- **Usage**: Used in fields like aerospace, automotive, and health for sending data like temperature, pressure, or speed.
- **Communication**: Typically one-way, from the remote device to the monitoring station.

### RC Receiver
- **Function**: Receives control signals in radio control systems and converts them to electronic signals.
- **Usage**: Utilized in controlling model airplanes, drones, cars, and boats.
- **Communication**: Primarily one-way, receiving signals from the transmitter; some systems may include two-way communication for telemetry.

## Microcontroller Pinouts

| Pinout | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| VCC (Voltage Common Collector) | Provides power to the microcontroller. Often denotes the positive voltage supply pin. |
| GND (Ground) | The ground pin is used to complete the circuit by providing a path for the current to return to the source. It's the reference point for all voltage measurements. |
| SCL (Serial Clock Line) | Used in I2C communication. It's the clock line controlled by the master device to synchronize data transmission over the I2C bus. |
| SDA (Serial Data Line) | Also used in I2C communication. This line is used for bidirectional data transfer between the master and slave devices. |
| TX (Transmit) | In UART communication, this pin is used to send data from the microcontroller to another device. |
| RX (Receive) | In UART communication, this pin is used to receive data by the microcontroller from another device. |
| PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) | These pins provide PWM output, which is used for controlling devices like motors and LEDs with variable power or brightness. |
| ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) | These pins are used to convert analog signals (like those from a sensor) into digital values that the microcontroller can process. |
| DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) | These pins convert digital values from the microcontroller into analog signals. Not all microcontrollers have DAC pins. |
| GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) | These pins can be programmed to act as either input or output, used for a wide range of purposes like reading sensors or controlling LEDs. |
| SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Pins | Includes MISO (Master In Slave Out), MOSI (Master Out Slave In), SCK (Serial Clock), and SS (Slave Select). Used for SPI communication, which is a serial communication protocol for short-distance communication primarily used to talk to sensors and SD cards. |
| RESET | Used to reset the microcontroller, making it restart its program from the beginning. |
